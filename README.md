# SailsRest

Sails.js Waterline adapter for REST APIs

## Installation

Install from NPM.

```bash
$ npm install sails-rest
```

## Compatibility

sails-rest is compatible with Sails.js v0.9.0 and above.

For Sails.js v0.9 please use v0.0.3 version of sails-rest.
 
For Sails.js v0.10 please use v0.0.4 version of sails-rest (or newer).

## Sails Configuration

Add the following config to the config/adapters.js file:

```javascript
module.exports.adapters = {

  default: 'rest',

  rest: {
    module: 'sails-rest',
    type: 'json',             // expected response type (json | string | http)
    host: 'api.url.io',       // api host
    port: 80,                 // api port
    protocol: 'http',         // HTTP protocol (http | https)
    rejectUnauthorized: true, // prevent https connections that use a self-signed certificate
    pathname: '/api/v1',      // base api path
    resource: null,           // resource path to use (overrides model name)
    action: null,             // action to use for the given resource ([resource]/run)
    query: {},                // query parameters to provide with all GET requests, accepts an object or a function (view below).
    methods: {                // overrides default HTTP methods used for each CRUD action
      create: 'post',
      find: 'get',
      update: 'put',
      destroy: 'del'
    },
    beforeFormatResult: function (result, collectionName, config, definition) { return result; },    // alter result prior to formatting
    afterFormatResult: function (result, collectionName, config, definition) { return result; },     // alter result after formatting
    beforeFormatResults: function (results, collectionName, config, definition) { return results; }, // alter results prior to formatting
    afterFormatResults: function (results, collectionName, config, definition) { return results; },  // alter results after formatting
    cache: {                  // optional cache engine
      engine : require('someCacheEngine')
    }
  }

};
```

## Caching

To cache API responses, you can add an object to the adapter's configuration with an attribute named `engine` that responds
to the following methods:

* `get(key)` - get cache key
* `set(key, value)` - set value on key
* `del(key)` - delete value identified by `key` from cache

An example caching configuration using LRU cache (`npm install --save lru-cache`) will look something like:

```javascript
// under config/cache.js

var LRU = require("lru-cache"),
    options = {
      max: 500,
      maxAge: 1000 * 10
    },
    cache = LRU(options);
module.exports = cache;

// under config/adapters.js

  rest: {
    module   : 'sails-rest',
    cache    : {
      engine : require('./cache')
    }
  }
```

Cache keys are computed from the API request URLs. This means that each unique URL will have its own cache key.

At the moment, cache busting is done by exact key only. This means that if you fetch `/users` and then update
`/users/1`, the cached objects under `/users` will not be purged to reflect your changes.

## Query option

The query option accepts either an object or a function returning an object. This function is only executed for GET requests.

The function's signature is:

```javascript
function (config, collectionName, methodName, options) {}
```

* _config_: the current configuration object
* _collectionName_: the name of the collection queried. ex: users
* _methodName_: the HTTP method used for the query, always GET for now.
* _options_: query parameters sent with the request, which by default are sails waterline query language

If you are using a function, you are 100% responsible for generating query parameters sent with the request.

By default, the query parameters generated by this adapter uses the sails waterline query language. So this is useful
if you need to convert parameters sent to your backend.

Example:

By default, this adapter generates:

```
GET /api/users?where={name:'John'}&limit=10&skip=0
```

```javascript
    ...
    query: function (config, collectionName, methodName, options) {

        var newOptions = {};

        if ( options.where.name ) newOptions.name = options.where.name;

        if ( options.limit ) newOptions.itemsPerPage = options.limit;

        // dont forget to pass on skip because this function is responsible for generating all the parameters
        newOptions.skip = options.skip;

        return newOptions;

    },
    ...
```

This function will generate:

```
GET /api/users?name=John&itemsPerPage=10&skip=0
```

## TODO

* Improve cache busting
* Add support for async cache engines (eg. redis_client)

## Change Log

### v0.0.3

* Fixing issue where only a single set of connection settings were stored, not separate settings for each model.
* Updating restler dependency to latest version.
* Adhering to JSHint object dot notation recommendation.
* Making cache configurable per collection.
* Reworking how requests are made. Now using a single method for making the request. Also allowing for specification of the method for each type of request and allowing overrides/defaults for resource action and query in the url.
* Fixing error handling conditional.
* Fixing issue with cloning of connection.
* Fixing improper methodName and restMethod.
* Allowing for destroying all items in collection as well as by query, instead of only id.
* Expanding test application to better suit suite of Waterline tests.
* Reworking result formatting.
* Referencing GitHub repo for reslter due to bugs that cause errors with tests.
* Decoding URL components for test support application.
* Abstracting logic to allow for deletion and updates of multiple items.
* Removing unused variable.
* Converting REST client from "restler" to "restify" due to bugs with restler module.
* Adding method to modify result before and after format and fixing formatResults method.
* Allowing for formatting before and after both individual results and all results.
* Expecting return value for result formatting functions.
* Modifying README to reflect new config options.
* Modifying README formatting to allow for better legibility on GitHub page.
* Removing redundant config.
